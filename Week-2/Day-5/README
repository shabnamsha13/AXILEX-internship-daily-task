***EXCEPTION HANDLING***
Exception handling is used to avoid program crash when an error occurs. We use try and except blocks to handle errors and make the program run safely.
Programs Included:
1. Try-except program-
  Expected outcome: Program should accept only numbers.
  Actual outcome: If user enters text instead of number, error message is shown instead of crashing.

2. Handle division by zero-
  Expected outcome: Program should perform division safely.
  Actual outcome: When user enters 0 as second number, it shows message 'Cannot divide by zero'.

3. Handle file errors-
  Expected outcome: Program should open and read the file.
  Actual outcome: If the file is not available, it shows message and program runs safely.

4. Custom exception example-
  Expected outcome: Program should check whether the balance is at least 1000
  Actual outcome: If balance is less than 1000, it shows custom error message. If balance is 1000 or more, transaction is successful and balance is displayed.
