EXCEPTION HANDLING:
Exception handling is used to avoid program crash when an error occurs. We use try and except blocks to handle errors and make the program run safely.
Programs Included:
1. Try-except program
  Expected outcome: Program should accept only numbers.
  Actual outcome: If user enters text instead of number, error message is shown instead of crashing.

2. Handle division by zero
  Expected outcome: Program should perform division safely.
  Actual outcome: When user enters 0 as second number, it shows message 'Cannot divide by zero'.

3. Handle file errors
  Expected outcome: Program should open and read the file.
  Actual outcome: If the file is not available, it shows message and program runs safely.

4. Custom exception example
  Expected outcome: Program should accept only valid age.
  Actual outcome: If negative age is entered, it shows custom error message.
