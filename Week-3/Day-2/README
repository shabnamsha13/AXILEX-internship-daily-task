Day 2 – FORMS & INPUT ELEMENTS:

Today I learned how to create a registration form using HTML.
I added different input fields like Name, Email, Phone Number, Password, and Gender.
I understood how to use proper labels and input types to collect user information correctly.
This helped me learn how websites take data from users through forms.

File Created: form.html
Expected Outcome: I should be able to design a basic form and understand how user input is collected in a web page.
Actual Outcome:I successfully created a registration form with proper fields and learned how each input type works.
