Ramadan wellness Planner:
This is a small frontend project made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website gives tips on how to keep a healthy and productive routine during Ramadan.

Technologies Used: HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3

How to Run:
1. Go to the project folder.
2. Click on the file called home.html twice to open it. Your browser will open on its own.
3. Use the menu to move around the pages.

Outcome: I was able to make a working and themed front-end website that showed how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in real life.﻿
